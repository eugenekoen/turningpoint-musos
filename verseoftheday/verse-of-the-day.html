    <title>VERSE OF THE DAY</title>

  MESSAGE OF THE DAY
  ------------------
  
  Today I listened to a song called "So will I". 
  
  The 3rd Chorus really spoke to me. Some lines:

  -----
  I can see Your heart in everything Youâ€™ve done
  Every part designed in a work of art called love
  I can see Your heart eight billion different ways
  Every precious one, a child You died to save
  If You gave Your life to love them so will I

  And then the song ends in this way:

  Like You would again a Hundred Billion times
  What measure could amount to Your desire

  You're the One who NEVER leaves the ONE behind.

  -----
  Let's find an excuse to be thankful to God for 
  all that He has done for us and may we express
  it in our Worship to Him. 
  
  -----------------------------------------------
  Romans 5:8 :- But God demonstrates His own Love 
  for us in this: While we were still sinners, 
  Christ died for us
