  CORNERSTONE
  -----------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  My hope is built on nothing less
  Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
  I dare not trust the sweetest frame
  But wholly trust is Jesus' name
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Christ alone, Cornerstone
  Weak made strong in the Savior's love
  Through the storm
  He is Lord
  Lord of all
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  When darkness seems to hide His face
  I rest on His unchanging grace
  In every high and stormy gale
  My anchor holds within the veil
  My anchor holds within the veil
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  He is Lord
  Lord of all
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  When He shall come with trumpet sound
  Oh may I then in Him be found
  Dressed in His righteousness alone
  Faultless, stand before the throne
  Faultless, stand before the throne
