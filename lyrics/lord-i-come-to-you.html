  POWER OF YOUR LOVE
  ==================
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Lord I come to You
  Let my heart be changed, renewed
  Flowing from the grace
  That I've found in You

  Lord I've come to know
  The weaknesses I see in me
  Will be stripped away
  By the power of Your love
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  Hold me close, let your love surround me
  Bring me near, draw me to your side
  And as I wait I'll rise up like the eagle

  And I will soar with You
  Your Spirit leads me on
  In the power of Your love
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Lord unveil my eyes
  Let me see You face to face
  The knowledge of Your love
  As You live in me
  
  Lord renew my mind
  As Your will unfolds in my life
  In living every day
  By the power of Your love
