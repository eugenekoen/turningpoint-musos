  10 000 Reasons  
  --------------

  CHORUS
  ------
  Bless the Lord, O my soul,
  O  my soul,
  Worship His holy name.
  Sing like never before,
  O  my soul.
  I'll worship Your holy name.
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  The sun comes up, it's a new day dawning;
  It's time to sing Your song again.
  Whatever may pass, and whatever lies before me,  
  Let me be singing when the even- ing comes.
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You're rich in love, and You're slow to anger.
  Your name is great, and Your heart is kind.
  For all Your goodness, I will keep on singing;
  Ten thousand reasons for my heart to find.
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  And on that day when my strength is failing,
  The end draws near, and my time has come;
  Still my soul will sing Your praise unending:
  Ten thousand years and then fore - - vermore!
    
  ENDING
  ------
  Yes, I will worship Your holy name.
  Lord, I'll worship Your holy name.
