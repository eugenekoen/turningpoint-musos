    <title>How Great You are - Aiden Whittaker</title>

  <pre data-key="G">
  ----------------------
  YOU CALL OUT THE STARS
  ----------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  When I think the closest star
  is more than a million miles away
  I can't even dream, how great you are
  When I think that all I have
  is what you've given me
  I'm so thankful Lord, so thankful Lord
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  You called out the stars and they shine for You (x2)
  How great You are Lord, how great You are! (x2)
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  When I think You walked on water,
  and calmed the raging seas
  I am overwhelmed, how great You are
  Amidst the storms and troubles, Lord you beckon me
  To walk on water, I'll walk on water
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  To whom can I compare You, Holy one?
  Who is Your equal, Lord there is none!
  There is none beside You, how great You are
  There is none so worthy, how great You are
  How great You are Lord, how great You are!
