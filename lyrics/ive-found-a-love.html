  -----------------
  I'VE FOUND A LOVE
  -----------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  When I call on Your name You answer
  When I fall You are there by my side
  You delivered me out of darkness
  Now I stand in the hope of new life.
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  By grace I'm free
  You've rescued me
  Now all I am is Yours
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  I've found a love greater than life itself
  I've found a hope stronger and nothing compares 
  I once was lost now I'm alive in You
  
  I come alive in You
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You're my God and my firm foundation
  It is You whom I'll trust at all times
  I give glory and praise, adoration
  To my Saviour who's seated on high
