  HAPPY DAY
  ---------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  The greatest day in history, 
  Death is beaten, you have rescued me,
  Sing it out, Jesus is alive!
  The empty cross, the empty grave, 
  Life eternal, you have won the day,
  Shout it out, Jesus is alive!
  He's alive!
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Oh, happy day, happy day, 
  You washed my sin away
  Oh, happy day, happy day,
  I'll never be the same
  Forever i am changed

  VERSE 2
  -------
  When i stand in that place,
  Free at last, meeting face to face, 
  I am yours, Jesus you are mine.
  Endless joy, perfect peace,
  Earthly pain finally will cease
  Celebrate, Jesus is alive,
  He's alive!
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Oh, what a glorious day
  What a glorious way
  That you have saved me!
  Oh, what a glorious day
  What a glorious name
