  SHOUT HOSANNA
  -------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  To the King of glory and light
  All praises
  To the only Giver of life
  Our Maker
  The gates are open wide
  We worship You

  Come see what love has done
  Amazing
  He bought us with His blood
  Our Savior
  The cross has overcome
  We worship You

  CHORUS
  ------
  Shout Hosanna
  Jesus He saves
  Shout Hosanna
  He rose from the grave
  Come and lift Him up
  Hosanna

  VERSE 2
  -------
  Now let the lost be found
  Forgiven
  Death could not hold Him down
  He's risen
  So let the saints cry out
  We worship You
  We worship You

  BRIDGE
  ------
  The same power that rolled the stone away  
  The same power alive in us today
  King Jesus we call upon Your name
  No other name
