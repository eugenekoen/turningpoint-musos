  ------------------------
  WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS
  ------------------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  When all around is fading, and nothing seems to last  
  When each day is filled with sorrow
  Still I know with all my heart
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  He's got the whole world in His hands
  He's got the whole world in His hands
  I'll fear no evil for You are with me
  Strong to deliver, mighty to save
  He's got the whole world in His hands
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  When I walk through fire, I will not be burned
  When the waves come crashing 'round me
  Still I know with all my heart
  
  TAG
  ---
  He's got the whole world in His hands
