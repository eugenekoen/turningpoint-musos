  -----------------
  THE RIVER IS HERE
  -----------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  Down the mountain the river flows
  And it brings refreshing wherever it goes
  Through the valleys and over the fields
  The river is rushing and the river is here
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  The river of God sets our feet a-dancing
  The river of God fills our hearts with cheer
  The river of God fills our mouths with laughter
  And we rejoice for the river is here
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  The river of God is teeming with life
  And all who touch it can be revived
  And those who linger on this river's shore
  Will come back thirsting for more of the Lord
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  Up to the mountain we love to go
  To find the presence of the Lord
  Along the banks of the river we run
  We dance with laughter giving praise to the Son
