  ------------
  HERE IS LOVE
  ------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  here is love, vast as the ocean
  loving kindness as the flood
  When the prince of life, our ransom
  shed for us his precious blood
  
  (repeat verse 1)
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  who his love will not remember
  who can cease to sing his praise?
  he can never be forgotten
  throughout heavens eternal days
  
  VERSE 2
  -------  
  on the mount of crucifixion
  fountains opened deep and wide
  through the floodgates of God's mercy  
  flowed a vast and gracious tide
  
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  grace and love like mighty rivers
  poured incessant from above
  and heavens peace and perfect justice
  kissed a guilty world in love
  
  (repeat chorus 1)
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  no love is higher, no love is wider
  no love is deeper, no love is truer
  no love is higher, no love is wider
  no love is like your love, O Lord
  
  TAG
  ---  
  here is love, vast as the ocean
  here is love, vast as the ocean
  here is love, vast as the ocean
  here is love, vast as the ocean
