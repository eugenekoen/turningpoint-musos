  AS THE DEER

  VERSE 1
  -------
  As the deer pants for the water
  so my soul longs after you
  you alone are my hearts desire
  and I long to worship you
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  You alone are my strength
  my shield, to you alone may
  my spirit yield. you alone
  are my hearts desire and I
  long to worship you.
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You're my friend and you are my brother
  even though you are a king
  I love you more than any other
  so much more than anything
