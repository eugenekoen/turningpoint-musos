  --------------------
  YOUR GRACE IS ENOUGH
  --------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  Great is your faithfulness oh God
  You wrestle with the sinners heart
  You lead us by still waters and to mercy
  And nothing can keep us apart
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  So remember your people
  Remember your children
  Remember your promise
  Oh God
  
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Your grace is enough
  Your grace is enough
  Your grace is enough for me
  
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Great is your love and justice God
  You use the weak to lead the strong
  You lead us in the song of your salvation 
  And all your people sing along
  
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  Your grace is enough
  Heav'n reaching down to us
  Your grace is enough for me
  God, I see Your grace is enough
  I'm covered in your love
  Your grace is enough for me
