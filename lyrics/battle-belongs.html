  BATTLE BELONGS
  ==============

  VERSE 1
  -------
  When all I see is the battle, you see my victory
  When all I see is the mountain, 
  you see a mountain moved
  And as I walk through the shadows, 
  your love surrounds me
  There's nothing to fear now, 
  for I am safe  with you
 
  CHORUS
  ------
  So when I fight, I’ll fight on my knees, 
  with my hands lifted high
  Oh God, the battle belongs to you
  Every fear I lay at your feet, 
  I’ll sing through the night
  Oh God, the battle belongs to you
 
  VERSE 2
  -------
  And if you are for me, who can be against me
  For Jesus there’s nothing impossible for you
  When all I see are the ashes, you see the beauty
  When all I see is a cross, 
  God you see the empty tomb 
 
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Almighty fortress, you go before us
  Nothing can stand against the power of our God
  You shine in the shadows you win every battle
  Nothing can stand against the power of our God
