  SHEPHERD
  --------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  In the process, in the waiting
  Youâ€™re making melodies over me
  And Your presence is the promise
  For I am a pilgrim on a journey
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  You will lift my head above the mighty waves
  You are able to keep me from stumbling 
  And in my weakness You are the strength that comes from within  
  Good Shepherd of my soul Take my hand and lead me on 
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You make my footsteps and my path secure so walking on water
  is just the beginning
  Cause my faith to arise, stand at attention 
  For You are calling me to greater things
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Oh how I love You, how I love You
  You have not forsaken me
  Oh how I love You, how I love You
  With You is where I want to be
