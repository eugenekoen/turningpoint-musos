  --------------------
  THI IS AMAZING GRACE
  --------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  Who breaks the power of sin and darkness
  Whose love is mighty and so much stronger
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings
  Who shakes the whole earth with holy thunder
  Who leaves us breathless in awe and wonder
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  This is amazing grace
  This is unfailing love
  That You would take my place
  That You would bear my cross
  You would lay down Your life
  That I would be set free
  Jesus, I sing for
  All that You've done for me
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Who brings our chaos back into order
  Who makes the orphan a son and daughter
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings
  Who rules the nations with truth and justice  
  Shines like the sun in all of its brilliance
  The King of Glory, the King above all kings
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
  Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
  Worthy is the Lamb who was slain
  Worthy is the King who conquered the grave
