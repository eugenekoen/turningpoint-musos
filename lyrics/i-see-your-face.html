  YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
  ----------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  I see Your face in every sun rise,
  the colours of the morning are inside your eyes
  The world awakens in the light of the day,
  I look up to the sky and say: You're beautiful
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  You're beautiful
  
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  I see your power in the moonlit night,
  where the planets are in motion and galaxies are bright.
  We are amazed in the light of the stars;
  it's all proclaiming who you are: You're beautiful
  
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  I see you there hanging on a tree,
  You bled and then You died and then You rose again for me.
  Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne;
  and soon we will be coming home: You're beautiful
  
  
  VERSE 4
  -------
  When we arrive at eternity's shore,
  where death is just a memory and tears are no more,
  We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring;
  Your bride will come together and we'll sing: You're beautiful
  
  
  TAG
  ---
  I see your face, You're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful  
  I see your face, You're beautiful, you're beautiful, you're beautiful
