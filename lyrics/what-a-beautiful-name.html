  ---------------------
  WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME
  ---------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  You were the Word at the beginning
  One With God the Lord Most High
  Your hidden glory in creation
  Now revealed in You Our Christ

  CHORUS 1
  --------
  What a beautiful Name it is, what a beautiful Name it is 
  The Name of Jesus Christ my King
  What a beautiful Name it is, nothing compares to this
  What a beautiful Name it is, the Name of Jesus
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You didn't want heaven without us
  So Jesus You brought heaven down
  My sin was great, Your love was greater
  What could seperate us now

  CHORUS 2
  --------
  What a wonderful Name it is, what a wonderful Name it is
  The Name of Jesus Christ my King
  What a wonderful Name it is, nothing compares to this
  What a wonderful Name it is, the Name of Jesus
  What a wonderful Name it is, the Name of Jesus

  BRIDGE 1
  --------
  Death could not hold You, the veil tore before You
  You silenced the boast of sin and grave

  The heavens are roaring, the praise of Your glory
  For You are raised to life again

  BRIDGE 2
  --------
  You have no rival, You have no equal
  Now and forever God you reign

  Yours is the Kingdom, Yours is the glory
  Yours is the Name above all names

  CHORUS 3
  --------
  What a powerful Name it is, What a powerful Name it is 
  The Name of Jesus Christ my King
  What a powerful Name it is, Nothing can stand against
  What a powerful Name it is, The Name of Jesus
