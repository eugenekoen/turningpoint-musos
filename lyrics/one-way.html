  ONE WAY - HILLSONG
  ------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  I Lay my life down at your feet, your the only one I need
  I turn to you and you were always there.
  In troubled times it's you I seek, 
  I put you first thats all I need,
  I humble all I am all to you!
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  One Way Jesus, your the only one that I could live for.
  One Way Jesus, your the only one that I could live for.
    
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You were always, always there. Every how and everywhere
  Your grace abounds so deeply within me
  You will never ever change, yesterday today the same
  Forever til forever meets no end
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  You are the way the truth and the life
  We live by faith and not by sight for you. 
  We're living all for you
