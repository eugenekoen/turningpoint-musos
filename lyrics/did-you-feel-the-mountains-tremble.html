  ----------------------------------
  DID YOU FEEL THE MOUNTAINS TREMBLE
  ----------------------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  Did you feel the mountains tremble?
  Did you hear the oceans roar?
  When the people rose to sing of
  Jesus Christ the risen One.
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Did you feel the people tremble?
  Did you hear the singers roar?
  When the lost began to sing of
  Jesus Christ the saving One.
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  And we can see that God You're moving.
  A mighty river through the nations.
  And young and old will turn to Jesus.
  Fling wide you heavenly gates,
  prepare the ways of the risen Lord.
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Open up the doors and let the music play,
  let the streets resound with singing.
  Songs that bring Your hope, songs that bring Your joy, 
  dancers who dance upon injustice.
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  Do you feel the darkness tremble?
  when all the saints join in one song?
  And all the streams flow as one river,
  to wash away our brokenness.
