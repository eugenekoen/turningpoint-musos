  RECKLESS LOVE
  -------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
    Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
    You have been so, so good to me
    Before I took a breath, You breathed Your life in me
    You have been so, so kind to me
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  Oh the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God
  Oh, it chases me down, fights 'till I'm found, leaves the ninety-nine
  I couldn't earn it  I don't deserve it  Still, You give yourself away
  Oh, the overwhelming, never ending, reckless love of God
      
  INSTRUMENTAL
  ------------
      
  VERSE 2
  -------
    When I was Your foe, still Your love fought for me
    You have been so, so good to me
    When I felt no worth, You paid it all for me
    You have been so, so kind to me

  BRIDGE
  ------
    There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, comin' after me
    There's no wall You won't kick down, lie You won't tear down, comin' after me
    There's no shadow You won't light up, mountain You won't climb up, comin' after me
    There's no wall You won't kick down, lie You won't tear down, comin' after me
