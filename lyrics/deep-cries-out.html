  DEEP CRIES OUT
  --------------  
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  It's open Heavens You're releasing
  And we will never be denied
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells
  We're stirring up deep deep waters
  We're going to dance in the river, dance in the river
  Cause we're stirring up deep deep wells
  We're stirring up deep deep waters
  We're going to jump in the river
  Jump in the river
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Deep cries out to deep cries out to
  Deep cries out to deep cries out to
  So we cry out to, we cry out to, You Jesus
  We're falling into deeper waters, calling out to You
  We're walking into deeper waters, going after You
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left
  And if He goes to the right then we'll go to the right
  We're going to jump jump jump jump in the river
  Jump jump jump jump, everybody

  If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left
  And if He goes to the right then we'll go to the right 
  We're going to dance dance, dance dance in the river
  Dance dance, dance dance, everybody

  If He goes to the left then we'll go to the left
  And if He goes to the left then we'll go to the right
  We're going to shout shout shout shout in the river
  Shout shout shout shout in the river, everybody
