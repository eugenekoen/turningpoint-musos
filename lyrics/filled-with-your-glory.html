  GILLED WITH YOUR GLORY
  ----------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  In my heart, in my heart, there's a fire burning
  A passion deep within my soul.
  Not slowing down, not growing cold
  An unquenchable flame that keeps burning brighter
  A love that's blazing like the sun 
  For who You are and what You've done.
  
  PRE-CHORUS 1
  ------------
  And as the fire is raging on.
  So Your praise becomes my song.
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  The whole earth Is filled with Your glory, Lord.
  Angels and men adore creation longs for what's in store.
  (Mountains bow and oceans roar)
  May You be Honored and glorified exalted and lifted high.
  Here at Your feet I lay my life.
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  From the ends of the earth to the heights of Heaven.
  Your glory, Lord, is far and wide 
  Through history You reign on high. 
  From the depths of the sea to the mountain's summit.
  Your power, Lord, it knows no bounds
  A higher love cannot be found.
  
  PRE-CHORUS 2
  ------------
  So let the universe proclaim
  Your great power and Your great Name
