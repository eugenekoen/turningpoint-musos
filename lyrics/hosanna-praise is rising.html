  --------------------------
  HOSANNA - PRAISE IS RISING
  --------------------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Praise is rising, eyes are turning to you
  We turn to you
  Hope is stirring, hearts are yearning for you
  We long for you
  When we see you we find strength to face the day
  In your presence all our fears are washed away, washed away
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Hosanna, hosanna
  You are the God who saves us
  Worthy of all our praises
 
  Hosanna, hosanna
  Come have your way among us
  We welcome you here Lord Jesus
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Hear the sound of hearts returning to you
  We turn to you
  In your kingdom broken lives are made new
  You make all things new
