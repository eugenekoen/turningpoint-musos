  --------------------
  YOUR LOVE AWAKENS ME
  --------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------      
  There were walls between us
  By the Cross You came and 
  broke them down, You broke them down
  There were chains around us
  By Your grace we are no longer bound
  No longer bound
 
  You called me out of the grave
  You called me into the light
  You called my name, and then my heart came alive!
  
  CHORUS
  ------      
  Your love is greater! 
  Your love is stronger!
  Your love awakens, awakens, 
  awakens me!

  VERSE 2
  -------      
  Feel the darkness shaking 
  All the dead are coming
  back to life, back to life
  Hear the song awaken all creation singing 
  we're alive, cause You're alive!
  You called me out of the grave
  You called me into the light
  You called my name, and then my heart came alive! 

  BRIDGE
  ------
  And what a love we found!
  Death can't hold us down!
  We shout it out, 
  "Weâ€™re alive cause You're alive!'
