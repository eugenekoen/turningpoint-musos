  AMAZING GRACE
  -------------
  Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
  That saved a wretch like me.
  I once was lost, but now im found,
  Was blind, but now I see.
  
  Twas grace that thought my heart to fear,
  and grace my fears released. How precious
  did that grace appear, the  hour I first believed. 
  
  When we've been there ten thousand years,
  bright shining as the sun,
  we've no less days to sing god's praise
  than when did when we first begun.
  
  Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
  That saved a wretch like me.
  I once was lost, but now im found,
  Was blind, but now I see.
