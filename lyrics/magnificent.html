  MAGNIFICENT
  -----------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  You show Your majesty
  In every star that shines
  And every time we breathe
  Your glory, God, revealed
  From distant galaxies
  To here beneath our skin
      
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  You are higher than we ever could imagine,
  closer than our eyes could ever see. You are...
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  Magnificent, You alone are holy
  No-one else as glorious as You
  Magnificent, Jesus you are holy
  Who can shine as brightly as You do?
  Magnificent
  You're so magnificent
      
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You're lighting up our lives
  Illuminate our hearts
  With everything You are.
      
  BRIDGE
  ------
  You are higher than we ever could imagine,
  closer than our eyes could ever see.
  We are pouring out our heart here in You presence.
