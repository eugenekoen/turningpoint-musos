  ================================================
  GOODNESS OF GOD
  ===============
  VERSE 1
  -------
  I love you, Lord
  For your mercy never fails me
  All my days, I’ve been held in your hands
  From the moment that I wake up
  Till I lay my head
  I will sing of the goodness of God
   
  CHORUS
  ------
  All my life you have been faithful
  All my life you have been so, so good
  With every breath that I am able
  I will sing of the goodness of God
   
  VERSE 2
  -------
  I love your voice
  You have led me through the fire
  In darkest night you are close like no other
  I’ve known you as a father
  I’ve known you as a friend
  I have lived in the goodness of God
   
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Your goodness is running after,
  It’s running after me
  Your goodness is running after,
  It’s running after me
  With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now
  I give you everything
  Your goodness is running after,
  It’s running after me
   
  Your goodness is running after,
  It’s running after me
  Your goodness is running after,
  It’s running after me
  With my life laid down, I’m surrendered now
  I give you everything
  Your goodness is running after,
  It’s running after me
