  BE LIFTED HIGH

  Be lifted high
  Be lifted high
  For Your glory, be lifted high. X4
  
  You're the King of all the ages
  You're the author of salvation
  You're the reason why we're singing for Your glory
  Lord release the sound of Heaven
  Let it rise in every nation
  We will join the anthem singing
  
  Be lifted high x4
  
  INSTRUMENTAL
  ------------  
  You're the everlasting Father
  You're the all consuming fire
  You're the reason why we're living for Your glory
  We will be the generation
  Calling down the reign of Heaven
  We will join the anthem singing

  CHORUS
  ------
  Be lifted high Be lifted high higher and higher Lord
  Be lifted high Be lifted high higher and higher Lord (2x)
  
  Be lifted high x2
