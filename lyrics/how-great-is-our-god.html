  --------------------
  HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD
  --------------------
  
  INTRO
  -----
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  The splendor of the King, clothed in majesty.
  Let all the Earth rejoice, all the Earth rejoice.
  He wraps Himself in light, and darkness tries to hide.
  And trembles at His voice, trembles at His voice.
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  How great is our God. Sing with me how great is our 
  God.
  And all will see how great, how great is our God.
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Age to age He stands. And time is in His hands.
  Beginning and the end, beginning and the end.
  The Godhead-three in one. Father, Spirit, Son.
  The Lion and the Lamb, Lion and the Lamb.
  
  JAMES VERSION ENDING  
  --------------------
  *Oh Come let us adore Him, Oh come let us
  adore Him, Oh come let us adore Him, Christ
  The Lord*
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Name above all names,
  Worthy of all praise,
  My heart will sing
  How great is our God.
