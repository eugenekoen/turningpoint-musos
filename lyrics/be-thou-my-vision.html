  -----------------
  BE THOU MY VISION
  -----------------
  Be Thou my vision O Lord of my heart
  Naught be all else to me, save that Thou art
  Thou my best thought, by day or by night
  Waking or sleeping, Thy presence my light.
  
  
  Be Thou my wisdom and Thou my true word
  I ever with Thee and Thou with me, Lord
  Thou my great Father and I Thy true son;
  Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee one.

  
  Be Thou my battle-shield, sword for the fight,
  be Thou my dignity, Thou my delight.
  Thou my soul's shelter, Thou my high tower:
  Raise Thou me heavenward, O Power of my power.

  
  Riches I heed not, nor man's empty praise
  Thou mine inheritance, now and always
  Thou and Thou only, first in my heart
  High King of heaven, my treasure Thou art.
  
  
  High King of heaven, my victory won,
  May I reach heaven's joys, O bright heav'ns son,
  Heart of my own heart, whatever befall,
  Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
  
  Still be my vision, O Ruler of all.
