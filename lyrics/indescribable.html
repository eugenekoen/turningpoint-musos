  INDESCRIBABLE
  -------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
  Creation's revealing Your majesty
  From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
  Every creature unique in the song that it sings
  All exclaiming
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Indescribable, uncontainable,
  You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
  You are amazing God
  All powerful, untameable,
  Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
  You are amazing God
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
  Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
  Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
  Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
  None can fathom
  
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  Indescribable, uncontainable,
  You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
  You are amazing God
  All powerful, untameable,
  Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
  You are amazing God
  
  Incomparable, unchangeable
  You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
  You are amazing God
  You are amazing God
