  <pre data-key="C">
  ---------
  I AM FREE
  ---------

  VERSE
  -----
  Through You the blind will see,
  Through You the mute will sing
  Through You the dead will rise,
  Through You all hearts will praise
  Through You the darkness flees
  Through You my heart screams I am free
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  I am free to run (I am free to run)
  I am free to dance (I am free to dance)
  I am free to live for You (I am free to live for You)
  I am free (I am free)
  
  VERSE
  -----
  Through You the kingdom comes,
  Through You the battle's won
  Through You I'm not afraid,
  Through You price is paid
  Through You there's victory
  because of you my heart sings I am free

  Who the sun sets free, is free indeed
