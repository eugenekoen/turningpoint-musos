  BUILD MY LIFE
  -------------
      
  VERSE 1
  -------
    Worthy of every song we could ever sing
    Worthy of all the praise we could ever bring
    Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe
    We live for You
      
      
  VERSE 2
  -------
    Jesus, the name above every other name
    Jesus, the only one who could ever save
    Worthy of every breath we could ever breathe  
    We live for You
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  Holy, there is no one like You
  There is none beside You
  Open up my eyes in wonder
  Show me who You are
  And fill me with Your heart
  And lead me in Your love to those around me
      
  BRIDGE
  ------
  I will build my life upon Your love
  It is a firm foundation
  I will put my trust in You alone
  And I will not be shaken
  I will build my life upon Your love
  It is a firm foundation
  I will put my trust in You alone
  And I will not be shaken
  I will build my life upon Your love
  It is a firm foundation
  I will put my trust in You alone
  And I will not be shaken
