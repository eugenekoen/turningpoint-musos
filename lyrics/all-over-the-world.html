  ALL OVER THE WORLD
  ------------------
      
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Even As the World began
  The stars they sang and all the angels
  Shouted for joy
  Shouted for joy

  And looking back through history
  Your people they have always had
  A song they must sing
  A song they must sing
      
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  We Are The People of God
  We'll Sing Your Song
  Here on the earth
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  All over the world Your song will resound
  All over the world Your praises ring out
  We're living to see You're name and renown
  All over the world
      
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Young and old, near and far
  There's a place for ev'ry heart to
  Join in your song
  Join in your song
 
  And ev'ry nation, tribe and tongue
  Come together join as one
  Give glory to God
  Glory to God
      
  BRIDGE
  ------
  Great is Your name
  And great will be your song 
  Great is Your name
  And great will be your song 

  We lift up our hands and pray
  We lift up our hands and pray
  
  For holy is Your name
