  --------------------------
  WATER YOU TURNED INTO WINE
  --------------------------
    
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Water You turned into wine
  Opened the eyes of the blind
  There's no one like You
  None like You

  Into the darkness You shine
  Out of the ashes we rise
  There's no one like You
  None like You
      
  CHORUS
  ------    
  Our God is greater
  Our God is stronger
  God You are higher than any other
  Our God is Healer
  Awesome in Power
  Our God,
  Our God
      
      
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Into the darkness You shine
  Out of the ashes we rise
  There's no one like You
  None like You
      
  BRIDGE
  ------
  And if our God is for us
  Then who could ever stop us?
  And if our God is with us
  Then what could stand against?
  And if our God is for us
  Then who could ever stop us?
  And if our God is with us
  Then what could stand against?
      
  What could stand against?
