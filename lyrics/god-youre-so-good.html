  Amazing love, that welcomes me, the kindness of mercy
  That bought with blood, wholeheartedly, my soul underserving

  God, You're so good, God, You're so good
  God, You're so good, You're so good to me

  Behold the cross, age to age, and hour by hour
  The dead are raised, the sinner saved, the work of Your power  
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  God, You're so good, God, You're so good
  God, You're so good, You're so good to me
  God, You're so good, God, You're so good
  God, You're so good, You're so good to me
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  I am blessed, I am called, I am healed, I am whole
  I am saved in Jesus' name
  Highly favored, anointed, filled with Your power
  For the glory of Jesus' name
  I am blessed, I am called, I am healed, I am whole
  I am saved in Jesus' name
  Highly favored, anointed, filled with Your power
  For the glory of Jesus' name
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  And should this, life bring suffering, Lord, I will remember  
  What Calvary, has bought for me, both now and forever
  
  God, You're so good, God, You're so good
  God, You're so good, You're so good to me
