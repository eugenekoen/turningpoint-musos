  EVER BE
  -------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Your love is devoted, like a ring of solid gold
  Like a vow that is tested, like a covenant of old
  Your love is enduring, through the winter rain
  And beyond the horizon, with mercy for today
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Faithful You have been, and faithful you will be
  You pledge yourself to me, and it’s why I sing
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
  Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips (x2)
    
  VERSE 2
  -------
  You Father the orphan, Your kindness makes us whole
  You shoulder our weakness, and Your strength becomes our own
  You’re making me like you, clothing me in white
  Bringing beauty from ashes, for You will have Your bride
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  Free of all her guilt, and rid of all her shame
  And known by her true name, and it’s why I sing
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
  Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips (x2)
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  You will be praised, You will be praised
  With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord
  You will be praised, You will be praised
  With angels and saints we sing worthy are You Lord  (x2)
  
  CHORUS
  ------  
  And it's why I sing
  Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips
  Your praise will ever be on my lips, ever be on my lips (x2)
