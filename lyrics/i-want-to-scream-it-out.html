  <pre data-key="A">
    YOU ARE GOOD
    ------------
     
    VERSE 1
    -------
    I want to scream it out
    From every mountain top
    Your goodness knows no bounds 
    Your goodness never stops
    Your mercy follows me 
    Your kindness fills my life
    Your Love amazes me
     
    CHORUS
    ------
    I sing because you are good 
    And I dance because you are good
    And I shout because you are good 
    You are good to me to me
     
    VERSE 2
    -------
    Nothing and no one comes
    Anywhere close to you
    The earth and oceans deep
    Only reflect this truth
    And in my darkest night 
    You shine as bright as day
    Your Love amazes me
     
    BRIDGE
    ------
    With a cry of praise My heart will proclaim 
    You are good You are good
    In the Sun or rain My life celebrates 
    You are good You are good 
     
    With a cry of praise My heart will proclaim 
    You are good You are good
    In the Sun or rain My life celebrates 
    You are good You are good
