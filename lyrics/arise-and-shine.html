  ---------------
  ARISE AND SHINE
  ---------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------  
  There is a light that shines, into the darkest night
  It gives the blind eye sight, light of the world
  There is a light so clear, the nations will draw near
  All those who walked in fear shall leap for joy
      
  CHORUS
  ------
  Arise and shine for your light has come
  And the glory of the Lord has risen in this place
  Arise and shine for your light has come
  And the glory of the Lord has risen in this place
      
  VERSE 2
  -------
  There is a trumpet sound, echoes for miles around
  It's when the church resounds with holy praise
  There is a sound so clear, the nations will draw near  
  All those who sowed in tears shall reap in joy
      
  CHORUS 2
  --------      
  Awake my soul, awake and sing
  That the glory of the Lord may cover all the earth
  Awake my soul, awake and sing
  That the glory of the Lord may cover all the earth
