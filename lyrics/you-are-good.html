  ------------
  YOU ARE GOOD
  ------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  I want to scream it out
  From every mountain top
  Your goodness knows no bounds
  Your goodness never stops
  Your mercy follows me
  Your kindness fills my life
  Your Love amazes me
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  I sing because You are good
  And I dance because You are good
  And I shout because You are good
  You are good to me to me
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Nothing and no one comes
  Anywhere close to You
  The earth and oceans deep
  Only reflect this truth
  And in my darkest night
  You shine as bright as day
  Your Love amazes me
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  With a cry of praise my heart will proclaim
  You are good You are good
  In the Sun or rain my life celebrates
  You are good You are good
  With a cry of praise my heart will proclaim
  You are good You are good
  In the Sun or rain my life celebrates
  You are good You are good
