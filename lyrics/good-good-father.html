  GOOD GOOD FATHER
  ----------------
   
  VERSE 1
  -------
  Oh, I've heard a thousand stories
  Of what they think You're like
  But, I've heard the tender whisper
  Of love in the dead of night
  And You tell me that You're pleased
  And that I'm never alone
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  You're a Good, Good Father
  It's who You are
  It's who You are
  It's who you are
  And I'm loved by You
  It's who I am
  It's who I am
  It's who I am
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Oh, and I've seen many  searching
  For answers far and wide
  But I know we're all searching
  For answers only You provide
  ‘Cause You know just what we need
  Before we, say a word  
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  ‘Cause You are perfect in all of your ways  
  Perfect in all of your ways
  You are perfect in all of Your ways to us

  You are perfect in all of your ways
  Oh, You’re perfect in all of your ways
  You are perfect in all of Your ways to us
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  Oh, it’s a love so un-deniable
  I, I can hardly speak
  Peace so un-explainable
  I, I can hardly think
  As You call me deeper still
  As You call me deeper still
  As You call me deeper still
  And to love, love, love

  INSTRUMENTAL ENDING
