    <title>Raise a Shout - Jon Daniel</title>
</head>

  <pre data-key="D">
  -------------
  RAISE A SHOUT
  -------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  On a cross there hung a man
  Who redefined who I am
  Like than man, there has been none
  Perfection murdered for the sake of love
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  On a cross there hung a man
  Who could have turned, who could have ran  
  In the garden he wept and said
  If it pleases you dad, my cup is death
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  Raise a shout, for the saviour
  Raise a shout, for the king
  I've got to shout, for these tears
  Are filled with freedom, as I sing
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  On a cross there hung a man
  Who broke the curse, of a helpless man
  If not for him, why would I rise
  But because of him, I'm breathing life
  
  VERSE 4
  -------
  On a cross there is no man
  Yes he died but he rose again
  Death is broken, heaven's awe
  Will be my portion forever more
