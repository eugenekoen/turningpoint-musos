  AMAZING GRACE
  -------------
  G            C          G
  Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                  D
  That saved a wretch like me.
          G                C       G
  I once was lost, but now im found,
      Em         D     G
  Was blind, but now I see.
  
          G                     C        G
  Twas grace that thought my heart to fear,
                          D           G
  and grace my fears released. How precious
              C      G      Em            D   G
  did that grace appear, the  hour I first believed. 
  
      G                           C       G
  When we've been there ten thousand years,
      G                     D
  bright shining as the sun,
      G                     C           G
  we've no less days to sing god's praise
      G                D          G
  than when did when we first begun.
  
  G            C          G
  Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
                  D
  That saved a wretch like me.
          G                C       G
  I once was lost, but now im found,
                  D     G
  Was blind, but now I see.
