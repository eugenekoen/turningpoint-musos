  F    C/E    Gm9  Bbmaj7

  VERSE 1
  -------
  F                   C/E
  The moon and stars they wept
                  Dm
  The morning sun was dead
                  Bbmaj7             F
  The Savior of the world was fallen
              C/E
  His body on the cross
                      Dm
  His blood poured out for us
                  Bbmaj7
  The weight of every curse was broken
  
  INTERLUDE

  F    C/E    Gm9  Bbmaj7
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  F                      C/E
  One final breathe He gave
                  Dm
  As heaven looked away
                  Bbmaj7           F
  The Son of God was laid in darkness
                  C/E
  A battle in the grave
                      Dm
  The war on death was waged
                  Bbmaj7        F
  The power of hell forever broken
  
  PRE-CHORUS
  ----------
  F                     C
  The ground began to shake
                      Dm
  The stone was rolled away
                      Bb            F/A
  His perfect love could not be overcome
                      C
  Now death where is your sting?
              Dm                      Bb
  Our resurrected King has rendered you defeated
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  F               C
  Forever He is glorified
  Dm              Bb
  Forever He is lifted high
  F              C
  Forever He is risen
      Dm             Bb
  He is alive, He is alive
