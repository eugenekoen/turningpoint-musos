  ----------------------
  YOU CALL OUT THE STARS
  ----------------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
      G
  When I think the closest star
              Am
  is more than a million miles away
            C                    G
  I can't even dream, how great you are
      G
  When I think that all I have
  Am
  is what you've given me
      C                          G
  I'm so thankful Lord, so thankful Lord
  
  CHORUS
  ------
                  C                        G
  You called out the stars and they shine for You (x2)
   D/F#      Em            D/F#      G
  How great You are Lord, how great You are! (x2)
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
      G
  When I think You walked on water,
   Am
  and calmed the raging seas
        C                      G
  I am overwhelmed, how great You are
  G
  Amidst the storms and troubles, Lord you beckon me
          Am                  G
  To walk on water, I'll walk on water
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
                C              G
  To whom can I compare You, Holy one?
           C                    G
  Who is Your equal, Lord there is none!
        D/F#   Em            D/F#      G
  There is none beside You, how great You are
        D/F#    Em          D/F#      G
  There is none so worthy, how great You are
   D/F#      Em            D/F#      G
  How great You are Lord, how great You are!
