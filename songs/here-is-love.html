  G2       D                G2
  here is love, vast as the ocean
  D                        A
  loving kindness as the flood
              D                   G2
  When the prince of life, our ransom
              D      A/C#     D
  shed for us his precious blood
  
  (repeat verse 1)

  who his love will not remember
          A7                D
  who can cease to sing his praise?
          Bm7         G
  he can never be forgotten
              D       A/C#    D
  throughout heavens eternal days

  G2     D              G2
  on the mount of crucifixion
              D               A
  fountains opened deep and wide
              D                   G2
  through the floodgates of God's mercy  
              D        A/C#     D
  flowed a vast and gracious tide
  
  CHORUS 2
  --------
                              A/D
  grace and love like mighty rivers
                          D
  poured incessant from above
              Bm7               G
  and heavens peace and perfect justice
              D      A/C#     D
  kissed a guilty world in love
  
  (repeat chorus 1)
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  D                 G2
  no love is higher, no love is wider
  D/F#               G2
  no love is deeper, no love is truer
  D                 G2
  no love is higher, no love is wider
  D/F#                  G2
  no love is like your love, O Lord
