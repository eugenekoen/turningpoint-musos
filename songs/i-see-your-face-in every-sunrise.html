  YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
  ----------------
  
  VERSE 1
  -------
  G                   C
  I see Your face in every sun rise,
        Em7                     Dsus4          D
  the colours of the morning are inside your eyes
  G                         C
  The world awakens in the light of the day,
     Em7                    Dsus4           D
  I look up to the sky and say: You're beautiful
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  G  C  Em7  Dsus4  D
  You're beautiful
  G  C  Em7  Dsus4  D
  
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  G                       C
  I see your power in the moonlit night,
             Em7                       Dsus4             D
  where the planets are in motion and galaxies are bright.
  G                 C
  We are amazed in the light of the stars;
            Em7                Dsus4           D
  it's all proclaiming who you are: You're beautiful
  
  
  VERSE 3
  -------
  G                       C
  I see you there hanging on a tree,
      Em7                                  Dsus4           D
  You bled and then You died and then You rose again for me.
  G                       C
  Now you are sitting on Your heavenly throne;
        Em7                                  Dsus4           D
  and soon we will be coming home: You're beautiful
  
  
  VERSE 4
  -------
  G                       C
  When we arrive at eternity's shore,
        Em7                        Dsus4           D
  where death is just a memory and tears are no more,
  G                       C
  We'll enter in as the wedding bells ring;
        Em7                              Dsus4             D
  Your bride will come together and we'll sing: You're beautiful
