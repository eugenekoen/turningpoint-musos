  INDESCRIBABLE

  VERSE 1
  -------
  C#m                                 B             E
  From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
  F#m              F#m7/E           D
  Creation's revealing Your majesty
  C#m                              B            E
  From the colours of fall to the fragrance of spring
  F#m                           F#m7/E           D
  Every creature unique in the song that it sings
  A2
  All exclaiming
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  E              B
  Indescribable, uncontainable,
  A2                                                  C#m
  You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                      A2
  You are amazing God
  E            B
  All powerful, untameable,
  A2                                             C#m
  Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
                      A2
  You are amazing God
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  C#m                                B               E
  Who has told every lightning bolt where it should go
  F#m                    F#m7/E                 D
  Or seen heavenly storehouses laden with snow
  C#m                              B            E
  Who imagined the sun and gives source to its light
  F#m                        F#m7/E                 D
  Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night
                  A2
  None can fathom
  
  CHORUS 2
  --------
  E              B
  Indescribable, uncontainable,
  A2                                                  C#m
  You placed the stars in the sky and You know them by name.
                      A2
  You are amazing God
  E            B
  All powerful, untameable,
  A2                                             C#m
  Awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly proclaim
                      A2
  You are amazing God
  
  
  E              B
  Incomparable, unchangeable
  A2                                                  C#m
  You see the depths of my heart and You love me the same
                      A2
  You are amazing God
                      A2
  You are amazing God
