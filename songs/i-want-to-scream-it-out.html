    YOU ARE GOOD
    ------------
     
    VERSE 1
    -------
    A
    I want to scream it out
    From every mountain top
    D
    Your goodness knows no bounds 
    Your goodness never stops
    F#m
    Your mercy follows me 
    Your kindness fills my life
    A                             E
    Your Love amazes me
     
    CHORUS
    ------
    A
    I sing because you are good 
    And I dance because you are good
    D
    And I shout because you are good 
    You are good to me to me
     
    VERSE 2
    -------
    A
    Nothing and no one comes
    Anywhere close to you
    D
    The earth and oceans deep
    Only reflect this truth
    F#m
    And in my darkest night 
    You shine as bright as day
    A                             E
    Your Love amazes me

    You are good You are good
             Bm7                                D
