  YOU ARE GOOD
  ------------

  VERSE 1
  -------
  B
  I want to scream it out
  From every mountain top
  E
  Your goodness knows no bounds
  Your goodness never stops
  G#m
  Your mercy follows me
  Your kindness fills my life
  B F#
  Your Love amazes me
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  B
  I sing because You are good
  And I dance because You are good
  E
  And I shout because You are good
  You are good to me to me
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  B
  Nothing and no one comes
  Anywhere close to You
  E
  The earth and oceans deep
  Only reflect this truth
  G#m
  And in my darkest night
  You shine as bright as day
  B F#
  Your Love amazes me
  
  BRIDGE
  ------
  C#m7 E
  With a cry of praise my heart will proclaim
  B
  You are good You are good
  C#m7 E
  In the Sun or rain my life celebrates
  B
  You are good You are good
  C#m7 E
  With a cry of praise my heart will proclaim
  B F#
  You are good You are good
  C#m7 E
  In the Sun or rain my life celebrates
  B F#
  You are good You are good
