  WHOLE WORLD IN HIS HANDS

  VERSE 1
  -------
  Em9                   Bm7    Bm9                     Bm7
      When all around is fading    and nothing seems to last  
  Em9                             Bm7
      When each day is filled with sorrow
          D                Bm7    A
  Still I know with all my heart
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  D             G                    A
      He's got the whole world in His hands
  D             G                    A
      He's got the whole world in His hands
                  Bm                G
  I'll fear no evil for You are with me
              F#                G
  Strong to deliver, mighty to save
  F#m                                  A
      He's got the whole world in His hands
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
  Em9                    Bm7  Em9              Em7
      When I walk through fire,   I will not be burned
  Em9                              Bm7
      When the waves come crashing 'round me
          D                Bm7    A
  Still I know with all my heart
