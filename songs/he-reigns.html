  VERSE 1
  -------      
              F
  It's the song of the redeemed
      C                         G
  Rising from the African plain
              F
  It's the song of the forgiven
  C                         G
  Drowning out the Amazon rain
              F
  The song of Asian believers
  C                        G
  Filled with God's holy fire
                          F
  It's every tribe, every tongue, every nation
  C                              G
  A love song born of a grateful   choir
      
      
  CHORUS
  ------      
  It's all God's children singing
      F             C

  VERSE 2
  -------      
          F
  Let it rise above the four winds
      C                          G
  Caught up in the heavenly sound
                              F
  Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals
          C                         G
  To the faithful gathered underground
                                  F
  Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation
  C                       G
  Some were meant to persist
                                  F
  Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples
  C                       G
  None rings truer than this
      
  BRIDGE
  ------
                  C/E
  And all the powers of darkness
  F                               G
  Tremble at what they've just heard
                  C/E
  'Cause all the powers of darkness 
  F                         G
  Can't drown out a single    word

  All God's children sing out

  He reigns, He reigns (He reigns)
      
  All God's people singing
      F             C
