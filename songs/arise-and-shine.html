  VERSE 1
  -------  
  A     A/G#  E                 A   A/G#  E
  There is a light that shines, into the darkest night
  A     A/G#   E                A       A/G#  E
  It gives the blind eye sight, light of the world
  A     A/G#  E             A       A/G#  E
  There is a light so clear, the nations will draw near
  A        A/G#  E              A        A/G#  E
  All those who walked in fear shall leap for joy
      
  CHORUS
  ------
              A                       C#m
  Arise and shine for your light has come
                  A                              E
  And the glory of the Lord has risen in this place
              A                       C#m
  Arise and shine for your light has come
                  A                             E
  And the glory of the Lord has risen in this place
      
  VERSE 2

  A      A/G#  E            A    A/G#  E
  There is a trumpet sound, echoes for miles around
  A       A/G#  E               A   A/G#  E
  It's when the church resounds with holy praise
  A      A/G#  E             A      A/G#  E
  There is a sound so clear, the nations will draw near  
  A        A/G#  E              A        A/G#  E
  All those who sowed in tears shall reap in joy

              A               C#m
  Awake my soul, awake and sing

  That the glory of the Lord may cover all the earth
