  GLORIUS DAY

  INTRO
  -----
  D

  VERSE 1
  -------
  D
  I was buried beneath my shame
        Bm7
  Who could carry that kind of weight?
        Gsus2            D
  It was my tomb 'Till I met You
    D
  I was breathing but not alive
     Bm7
  All my failures I tried to hide
        Gsus2            D
  It was my tomb 'Till I met You 
            Gsus2
  You called my name and
                     D
  I ran out of that grave
  
  CHORUS
  ------
  D          Gsus2                           D
  Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
  D             Gsus2                            Bm7
  You called my name and I ran out of that grave
         Gsus2                          D
  Out of the darkness into Your glorious day
  
  INSTRUMENTAL

  D
  
  VERSE 2
  -------
       D
  Now Your mercy has saved my soul
       Bm7
  Now Your freedom is all that I know
           Gsus2                  D
  The old made new, Jesus, when I met You
            Gsus2                           D
  You called my name and I ran out of that grave

  BRIDGE
  ------
  D
  I needed rescue, my sin was heavy
  D
  But chains break at the weight of Your glory
  D
  I needed shelter, I was an orphan
  D
  Now You call me a citizen of Heaven
  D
  When I was broken, You were my healing
  D
  Now Your love is the air that I'm breathing
  Bm7              Asus4
  I have a future, my eyes are open
                               Gsus2
  'Cause when You called my name
                     D
  I ran out of that grave
