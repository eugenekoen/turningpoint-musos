  NOTHING WITHOUT YOU
  -------------------

  VERSE
  -----
      D       E           A
  If it had not been for the Lord
        D      E      A
  who was always on my side
    D   E                    A
  The enemy would have swallowed us
            D    E           A
  Would have drowned in their waters
  
        D          E         A
  But our souls have found an escape
         D    E    A
  A hiding place in You
    D       E          A
  The fowler's snare is broken
      D           E            A
  Our help is in the name of the Lord
  

  CHORUS
  ------
                   E           F#m7
  I'm nothing without You without You
     D       E           A
  You are the air that I breathe
                   E           F#m7
  Can't live without You without You
         D                E         A
  In You I live and move and have my being
  
     E        F#m7
  Hosanna to Jehovah
     D       E           A
  You are the air that I breathe
     E        F#m7
  Halellujah Halellujah
         D                E         A
  In You I live and move and have my being
